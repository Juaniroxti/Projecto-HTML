            Is your neighbour's dog a soviet spy?
        </h1>
        <h2>
            In this article we are going to discuss the posibility and ratio of probability that
            your neighbour's dog is a russian communist spy.
        </h2>
        <p>
            We live in an era where everything is possible even the possibility of your neighbour's dog
            being a soviet spy if you are a responsible american citizen you need to be aware of that. 
            The soviets have devoleped a network of soviet dog spies that are spreading in american soil
            the main suspects of being a spy are the street ones so don't house them and be weary of your neighbour's dog
            if it is not adopted by the official refugees and has no pedigree, then that's clue number one. we are going to list a number
            of things that soviet dogs spy do that is meant to either inform of you and your loved ones or contact their superiors.
        <ul>
            <li>
            <h3>Do they bark?</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Sometimes the stray dogs barking is a way of comunicating with other spies and their superiors.
            </p>
            <li>
            <h3>Do they pee/poop a lot?</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                When they pee/poop or even in somecases smell your house or neighbourhood they are planting surveilance.
            </p>
            <li>
                <h3>Do they bark at night?</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                This might sound redundant but dogs that bark specially at night they are trying to disrupt your sleep so that you can't perform well during the day.
            </p>
            <li>
                <h3>Are ther more than 1 dog</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                This one is most dangerous as groups of dogs are designed to give highly accurate intel to the kremlin.
