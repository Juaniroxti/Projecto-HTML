            Naive kid thinks he can program
        </h1>
        <h3>
    How did you get in the bootcamp?
        </h3>
    <p>
        Well Juana prime, I got in the bootcamp by bypassing the recruitment a 
        friend that was already in the bootcamp share the link to the discord and started loging to the clases. 
        I had no previous experience on anything related with programing but I did the placement exam
        and I got into the second level so I was starting to believe I could this with a bit of practicing.
    </p>
        <h3>
    Why did you decide to join?
        </h3>
    <P>
        I'm glad you asked, I was actually looking to get into the tech industry software always came someawhat natural
        to me. I'm very selfeducated I usually test a lot and like the process of figuring something out. 
    </P>
        <h3>
    Are you aware that the people on the bootcamp might choose to expell you if they found out you stowed away?
        </h3>
    <P>
        Oh yes, most defenetely that's something I certainly considered but regardless of that I don't think they are gonna care that much. Besides I probably have the best
        english in the entire bootcamp so I have someawhat of an advantage, given that most programing languages are written in english it gives me plenty to work with to figure
        everything out without much help.
    </P>
        <h3>
    So if you don't need much help how are your team skills? I mean do you know or are competent working in a team?
        </h3>
    <P>
        Not only am I competent I usually end up leading the teams I work just fine with a team I could even tell I work best
        see I have trouble with things that are boring to me, so if something is boring or I don't really feel like doing it 
        the team helps me keep grounded so I'm finishing my tasks and covering my weaknesses.
    </P>
